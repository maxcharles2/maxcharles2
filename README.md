## Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:
From an early age, I was drawn to numbers—thanks to my grandmother, who introduced me to math fundamentals. That love for logic and analysis grew throughout college, where my curiosity led me to thrive as an Exercise Science major. I became a DifferenceMaker semifinalist, earned admission to MGH’s DPT program, published an honors thesis, and received an “Award of Excellence” in research. Now, as a software engineer, I bring that same drive and passion for learning to solving complex problems with clean, data-informed solutions. I’m eager to join a team where I can continue learning, contribute meaningfully, and grow into an impactful developer. Let’s build something great together.

# 💻 Tech Stack:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB
