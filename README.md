## Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:
From an early age, I was drawn to numbers—thanks to my grandmother, who introduced me to math fundamentals. That love for logic and analysis grew throughout college, where my curiosity led me to thrive as an Exercise Science major. I became a DifferenceMaker semifinalist, earned admission to MGH’s DPT program, published an honors thesis, and received an “Award of Excellence” in research. After working with ACL patients and college athletes, I decided to explore careers that could blend my passion for logic, analysis, and data. Now, as a software engineer, I’m excited to build ProgressPulse, a web app that allows physical therapists to create plans for patients and track their progress over time. I’m eager to bring my background and contribute as an impactful full-stack developer. Let’s build something great together!
