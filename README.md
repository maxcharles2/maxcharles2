## Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:
From an early age, I have always been drawn to numbers, thanks to my grandmother who introduced me to math fundamentals. That love for logic and analysis grew throughout college, where my curiosity led me to thrive as an Exercise Science major. I became a DifferenceMaker semifinalist, earned admission to MGH’s DPT program, published an honors thesis, and received an “Award of Excellence” in research. After working with ACL patients and college athletes, I decided to explore careers that could blend my passion for logic, analysis, and data. Now as a software engineer, I’m excited to present ProgressPulse, a full-stack app that allows physical therapists to create plans for patients and track their progress over time. More recently, I joined an engineering team building an AI-powered learning tool where I worked on the AI student learning progress, REST APIs, as well as the integration of the model with the help of the Vercel AI SDK. I’m eager to code and contribute as an impactful engineer in your team, let’s build something great together!
